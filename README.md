# OCPC: Object-Centric-Process-Cube

This project introduces a stand-alone object-centric process cube tool built on the PM4PY-MDL process mining framework. The application is witten in Python  Tk  GUI  toolkit  as  the  user interface . At the moment, the application has four three parts:
- Input: You can insert an OCEL log using the submenue for inserting a log. Ana example of OCEL is located in example_OCEL. This example file contains information about both events and objects inovlved in the events. In this module, we vizualize the imported OCEL in separate tables that show the attributs of events and objects.
- 
- the   input   is   JSON-OCEL/XML-OCEL.   In   anOCEL,  an  event  is  related  to  event  attributes  and  somepossible  objects  related  to  that  event.  Furthermore, eachobject  can  have  its  own  properties  in  another  table.Therefore, as shown in Figure 1, in the first highlightedsub window, we have shown events with event attributesand  their  objects  in  one  table,  whereas,  objects  withintheir  attributes  are  shown  in  separate  tables.  The  usercan  select  event  attributes  and  object  attributes  as  thedimensions of the process cube and build the cube
