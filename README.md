# OCPC: Object-Centric-Process-Cube

This project introduces a stand-alone object-centric process cube tool built on the PM4PY-MDL process mining framework. The application is witten in Python  Tk  GUI  toolkit  as  the  user interface . At the moment, the application has three parts:
- Input: You can insert an OCEL log using the submenue for inserting a log. An example of OCEL is located in example_OCEL which contains information about both events and objects inovlved in the events. In this module, we vizualize the imported OCEL in separate tables that show the attributs of events and objects. The comprehensive information regarding OCEL is explained in [OCEL Standard Document](http://ocel-standard.org/). In this step, the user can select the dimensions of the process cube to create a process cube. The details of cube creation steps are found in module cube creation.
- Wizard: When the cube is created, it is possible to vizuialize the process cube in two different windows. The user can simply select columns and rows to visuilize the cube. Some options such as discovery of [MVP models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02562.pdf) and [Object-Centric Petri Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02047.pdf) are possible in this tool.
